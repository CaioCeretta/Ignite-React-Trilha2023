# What are Design Systems?

## What are design systems? 

Let's use a big enterprise such as the own rocketseat. Design systems are important because, let's think about a company
with large teams on it, Each team is developing a front end project, it's very common that the applications layout end up
going out of the company pattern, but we want them to be followed in all applications, so in the end of the day, the user
won't notice the transition between all those apps and everytime the same kind of layout, spacings, colors, are used throughout
all the layouts.
It's very common, inside the design area, as well as the programming area, many times these patterns aren't followed and
we end up having some minimal alterations on the patterns and differences between all these layouts.

## Design Systems Concept

Because of all of that that has been said, this is where the design system concept came in. A design system is a docummentation
of the patterns to be followed on the layout of many applications inside the company.

A design system is all and any visual element that can be shared inside any company application. So it's not a UI library.
It's common to think that we are going to include inside the design system, any component we may have in more than one
application, but this is not the concept.

The concept of a design system is for us to include inside of it, only visual elements that can be reused in ANY application,
not in two or three. So if we have visual elements that we understand that cannot be shared to ANY application of the company,
for those cases we create a UI Kit.

In rocketseat design systems, we are able to find things that are very specific and can be shared with any application.
So we'll find the avatar element, dropdowns, tooltips, modals, many elements which can be shared, so they can be in an
app that is an admin panel, or a end user front end, or any application we want.

## What are UI Kits, and why to use tem?

As said before, if one element, cannot be used in one other application, it's not meant to be placed on the design system,
this is where the UI Kit comes in, they are a collection of components reusable between the apps, so if we see that two
applications are using the same menu layout, we can create a UI kit to install many smaller packages of components.
